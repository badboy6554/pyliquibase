# React + Aleo + Leo

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/AleoHQ/sdk/tree/testnet3/create-aleo-app/template-react)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React and Aleo working in Vite
with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This template includes a Leo program that is loaded by the web app located in
the `helloworld` directory.

Note: Webpack is currently used for production builds due to a
[bug](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13367) with Vite related to nested
workers.

### Start in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should be running on http://localhost:5173/

### Build Leo program

1. Copy the `helloworld/.env.example` to `helloworld/.env` (this will be ignored
   by Git):

   ```bash
   cd helloworld
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Replace `PRIVATE_KEY=user1PrivateKey` in the `.env` with your own key (you
   can use an existing one or generate your own at https://aleo.tools/account)

3. Follow instructions to install Leo here: https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo

4. You can edit `helloworld/src/main.leo` and run `leo run` to compile and update the
   Aleo instructions under `build` which are loaded by the web app.

## Deploy program from web app

> [!WARNING]  
> This is for demonstration purposes or local testing only, in production applications you
> should avoid building a public facing web app with private key information

Information on generating a private key, seeding a wallet with funds, and finding a spendable record can be found here
if you are unfamiliar: https://developer.aleo.org/testnet/getting_started/deploy_execute_demo

Aleo programs deployed require unique names, make sure to edit the program's name to something unique in `helloworld/src/main.leo`, `helloworld/program.json`, rename `helloworld/inputs/helloworld.in` and rebuild.

1. In the `worker.js` file modify the privateKey to be an account with available
   funds

   ```js
   // Use existing account with funds
   const account = new Account({
     privateKey: "user1PrivateKey",
   });
   ```

2. (Optional) Provide a fee record manually (located in commented code within `worker.js`)

   If you do not provide a manual fee record, the SDK will attempt to scan for a record starting at the latest block. A simple way to speed this up would be to make a public transaction to this account right before deploying.
   
3. Run the web app and hit the deploy button

## Production deployment

### Build

`npm run build`

Upload `dist` folder to your host of choice.

### ⚠️ Header warnings

`DOMException: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker': SharedArrayBuffer transfer requires self.crossOriginIsolated`

If you get a warning similar to this when deploying your application, you need
to make sure your web server is configured with the following headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

We've included a `_headers` file that works with some web hosts (e.g. Netlify)
but depending on your host / server setup you may need to configure the headers
manually.

## Installation

### Swift Package (Recommended)
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/ "") is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code that is well integrated with Swift build system.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `web3swift` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
]
```

Or if your project is not a package follow these guidelines on [how to add a Swift Package to your Xcode project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).


## Example usage
In the imports section:

```swift
import web3swift
import Web3Core
```

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate web3swift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '13.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'web3swift'
end
```

Then, run the following command:
```bash
$ pod install
```

> **WARNING**: CocoaPods is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in iOS development, but it also has some limitations that preventing us of providing first class support there. We highly recommend using SPM first as using CocoaPods will delay new updates and bug fixes being delivered to you.

### Send Ether
```swift
let transaction: CodableTransaction = .emptyTransaction
transaction.from = from ?? transaction.sender // `sender` one is if you have private key of your wallet address, so public key e.g. your wallet address could be interpreted
transaction.value = value
transaction.gasLimitPolicy = .manual(78423)
transaction.gasPricePolicy = .manual(20000000000)
web3.eth.send(transaction)
```

### Contract read method
```swift
let contract = web3.contract(Web3.Utils.erc20ABI, at: receipt.contractAddress!)!
let readOp = contract.createReadOperation("name")!
readOp.transaction.from = EthereumAddress("0xe22b8979739D724343bd002F9f432F5990879901")
let response = try await readTX.callContractMethod()
```

### Write Transaction and call smart contract method
```swift
let abiString = "[]" // some ABI string
let bytecode = Data.fromHex("") // some ABI bite sequence
let contract = web3.contract(abiString, at: nil, abiVersion: 2)!
let parameters: [Any] = [...]
let deployOp = contract.prepareDeploy(bytecode: bytecode, constructor: contract.contract.constructor, parameters: parameters)!
deployOp.transaction.from = "" // your address
deployOp.transaction.gasLimitPolicy = .manual(3000000)
let result = try await deployTx.writeToChain(password: "web3swift")
```

### Sending network request to a node
```swift
func feeHistory(blockCount: UInt, block: BlockNumber, percentiles:[Double]) async throws -> Web3.Oracle.FeeHistory {
    let requestCall: APIRequest = .feeHistory(blockCount, block, percentiles)
    let response: APIResponse<Web3.Oracle.FeeHistory> = try await APIRequest.sendRequest(with: web3.provider, for: requestCall) /// explicitly declaring `Result` type is **required**.
    return response.result
}
```
## Build from source
### SPM
```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift.git
cd web3swift
swift build
```

## Requirements
- iOS 13.0 / macOS 10.15
- Xcode 12.5
- Swift 5.5

## Documentation
Documentation is under construction👷🏻👷🏼‍♀️. We’re trying our best to comment all public API as detailed as we can, but the end it still far to come. But in one of the nearest minor updates we’ll bring DocC support of already done amount of docs. And your PR in such are more than welcome.

## Projects that are using web3swift
Please take a look at [Our customers](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/Our-Customers) wiki page.

## Support

**[Join our discord](https://discord.gg/8bHCNmhS7x) and [Telegram](https://t.me/web3swift) if you need support or want to contribute to web3swift development!**

- If you **need help**, please take a look at our [FAQ](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/FAQ "") or [open an issue](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/issues).
- If you'd like to **see web3swift best practices**, check [Projects that using web3swift](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/wiki/Our-Customers).
- If you **found a bug**, [open an issue](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift/issues).

## Development
To do local development and run the local tests, we recommend to use [ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) which is also used by CI when running github actions.

```cli
// To install
$ npm install ganache --global

// To run
$ ganache
```

This will create a local blockchain and also some test accounts that are used throughout our tests.
Make sure that `ganache` is running on its default port `8546`. To change the port in test cases locate `LocalTestCase.swift` and modify the static `url` variable.

### Before you commit

We are using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run validations locally before a commit is created. Please, install pre-commit and run `pre-commit install` from project's root directory. After that before every commit git hook will run and execute `codespell`, `swiftlint` and other checks.

# Ecommerce REST API

- Hey I am building a rest api for my ecommerce website, which will be used by the frontend to fetch data.

- I have just started with this project and I am still learning the basics of rest api.

- Hoping to learn more about rest api and get a better understanding of it.

## Inspiration
Are you tired of your old NFTs but not really into selling them? What about modifying them with our tool?  

## What it does
We made a protocol to modify existing NFTs with the help of neural networks using different filters (adding animation and movements, changing style, background, and many others)

## How we built it
We developed the smart contract that uses the create2 mechanism that provides the technology to allow one NFT to own another. As well we trained a neural network to perform animation transfer of motion from source NFT to another NFT. Later other types of neural networks transformation types can be added and applied

## Challenges we ran into
It was quite challenging to run a virtual machine with GPU to perform neural network inference. As well we faced some difficulties with the frontend part (deployment and interaction with a smart contract) 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We succeeded in training a neural network to generate good-quality gifs and created some funny NFTs. 

## What we learned
How to work with Polygon
How to mint NFT tokens
How to create proxy-contract
How to train and deploy neural networks
How to run GPU virtual machine
How to use Flask

## What's next for DO[NFT] - Dynamic Ownable NFT Collection
We will try to release our project in mainnet Polygon and start to attract NFT creators
